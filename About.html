                    <h1>The Feng Shui City</h1>
                     <p> Edo (The capital city's name during the Tokugawa dynasty) became known as the Feng Shui city after the Tokugawa shogunate choose to build the new capital there and further restructured to become more vibrant and successful. Shogun Leyasu Tokugawa made this choice looking at how the city was in a favorable situation as in japanese culture the east is the direction where new energy is born and that coupled with Mt.Fuji, which was worshipped as a divinity and long-regarded as a source of positive 'Qi'.</p>
                     <p>Combining the power of the East with the Qi from Mt.Fuji Tokugawa the began a project to build a canal network around the city and even reloacte Tone river which opened int Tokyo bay from the pacific to allow the city to take a lucky form. This project took a whole 60 years and this monumental effort to build the infrastructure of the city is why is why Edo(Tokyo) is said to a Feng Shui city.</p>

                    <h1>Location</h1>
                     <p>Tokyo, officially Tokyo Metropolis, is the capital of Japan and one of its 47 prefectures. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world. It is the seat of the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese government. Tokyo is in the Kanto region on the southeastern side of the main island Honshu and includes the Izu Islands and Ogasawara Islands. Formerly known as Edo, it has been the de facto seat of government since 1603 when Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters. It officially became the capital after Emperor Meiji moved his seat to the city from the old capital of Kyoto in 1868; at that time Edo was renamed Tokyo. Tokyo Metropolis was formed in 1943 from the merger of the former Tokyo Prefecture and the city of Tokyo.</p>

                    <h1>Facts</h1>
                     <p>One of the busiest pedestrian crossings in the world, Shibuya crossing is perhaps the most iconic symbol of the city of Tokyo around the world.
                        Shibuya Crossingâ€™s large advertising screens and heavy foot traffic means it is often compared to the Times Square intersection in New York and Piccadilly Circus in London, and it is often seen as representative of the ultra-modern image of Tokyo projected worldwide.                        
                        The history of Shibuya Crossing dates back over 100 years to the construction of Shibuya Station in 1885. Originally only serving as a stop on the Shinagawa metro line, now known as the JR Yamanote Line, it has since expanded to serve over 8 different metro lines in Toyko.</p>

                    <h1>Food</h1>
                     <p>Tokyo is one of the world's most exciting dining destinations. The city features a wide range of both local and regional Japanese cuisine in addition to all types of international fare. Its top restaurants have accrued more Michelin stars than both Paris and New York combined. But good food can be found at every price range from cheap hole-in-the-wall joints to expensive high-class restaurants with every budget in between.</p>
