                    <h1>Outdoor Museums</h1>
                     <p>Tokyo's Outdoor museums have a treasure-hunt appeal: you navigate through gardens and forests to find something that pops out behind a rock, emerges from a pond, or perfectly decorates the landscape. These sprawling alfresco galleries are ideal for getting back to nature while also marvelling at the work of great creative minds. Plus, they’re perfect for families with kids who need room to play. Examples being-the Hakone Open-Air Museum opened in 1969 in the serene countryside setting of Kanagawa prefecture, about an hour south of Tokyo by train. You’ll find roughly 120 works by artists spanning the 19th century to the 21st dotted around the expansive green area, some quietly blending into the terrain, others standing out starkly. </p>

                     <p>Crewing up with local talent and translators and respecting the territory’s long-established filmmaking traditions can help international producers ensure a smooth and efficient shoot in Japan.The country’s ambitions were bolstered when the government introduced a production incentive programme for international film and high-end TV productions. Japan had previously been perceived as expensive and reluctant to accommodate potentially disruptive requests for filming.</p>
